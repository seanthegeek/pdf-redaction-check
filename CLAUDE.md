# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Model roles

Any new feature or modification to an existing feature must follow this model
split:

1. **Plan with Fable** (fall back to Opus only if Fable is unavailable). Enter
   plan mode, design the implementation, and present the plan to the user for
   approval or modification. Do not start implementing until the user approves
   the plan.
2. **Implement with Sonnet by default; use Opus for large or complex work.**
   Once the plan is approved, carry out the implementation by delegating the
   implementation steps to subagents via the Agent tool. Use `model: "sonnet"`
   for routine, well-scoped changes (single-module edits, bug fixes, small
   features). Use `model: "opus"` when the approved plan is a large multi-file
   feature or refactor, or when the change is complex even if contained —
   subtle parsing or encoding logic, concurrency, or a paired protocol
   (`__getstate__`/`__setstate__`, save/load, encode/decode) where one side is
   easy to get silently wrong. Most changes to the PDF parsing and font-charset
   logic in this project fall into the second group: encoding handling
   (`cp1252`, `mac_roman`, UTF-16BE `ToUnicode` values) is exactly the kind of
   code that looks right and is wrong. When in doubt, decide at planning time
   and note the choice in the plan.
3. **Review with Fable** (fall back to Opus only if Fable is unavailable). After
   implementation, all work must be reviewed by Fable before it is considered
   done.

**PR reviews** must also use Fable, with Opus as the fallback if Fable is
unavailable.
